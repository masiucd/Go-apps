# File upload2.0

## Description

This is a simple file upload application. It allows users to upload files and view them. The files are stored in a database and can be downloaded by clicking on the file name.
To store the file in a database we need to convert the file into a byte array. This byte array is then stored in the database. When the file is downloaded, the byte array is converted back to the file and downloaded.
