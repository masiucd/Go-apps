# File upload

## About

This is a simple file upload application that allows users to upload files to the server.
And then view the uploaded files.

### Notes

- The form attribute `enctype="multipart/form-data"` is required when you are using forms that have a file upload control. Without this attribute, the file upload will not work with binary files only text files.
