# Injury statistics

## About

Reading CSV files with data about injuries and plotting the data.

Since the data are large we want to optimize the code to be able to read and plot the data in a reasonable time.

The CSV files are publicly available at [https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/)
